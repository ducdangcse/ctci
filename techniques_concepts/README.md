## Bit Manipulation: Lonely Integer

### XOR
XOR forms an Abelian Group as it has the following properties.

* Commutativity: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$
* Associativity: $(A \oplus B) \oplus C = A \oplus (B \oplus C)$
* Identity exists: there is a bit string, 0, (of length N) such that $A \oplus 0 = A$ for any $A$
* Each element is its own inverse: for each $A$, $A \oplus A = 0$.
